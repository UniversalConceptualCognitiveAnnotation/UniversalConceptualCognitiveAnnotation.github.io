Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation (UCCA) is a novel semantic approach to grammatical representation. It was developed in the Computational Linguistics Lab of the Hebrew University by [Omri Abend](http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~oabend) and [Ari Rappoport](http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~arir).

The central idea of the project is to analyze and annotate natural languages using purely semantic categories and structure (a graph). Syntactic categories and structure are not part of the manual annotation, and are ideally learned implicitly by the parsers. The basic set of semantic categories (the foundational layer) is inspired by work in linguistic typology, cognitive grammar, and neuroscience. The development of additional layers, such as semantic roles and super-senses (adapted from the [CARMLS project](https://github.com/nert-gu/streusle/)) is underway.

The annotation so far focused on argument-structure and linkage phenomena. We build primarily on _Basic Linguistic Theory_ (R.M.W. Dixon, 2010a; 2010b; 2012), a widely used approach for language description. We acknowledge that there many applicable analyses for a given sentence, but select, for practical reasons, a small set of highly useful distinctions, and apply them to provide one plausible annotation.

We have annotated 160K tokens from English Wikipedia with the UCCA scheme, as well as a 30K English-French parallel corpus based on Jules Verne's "20K Leagues Under The Sea", and a 120K tokens corpus of the entire book in German. Pilot studies were conducted on several other languages as well.

## Annotation Web-App

UCCAApp is a web application for phrase-based annotation in general, and UCCA parsing in particular.
Formally, it supports DAG structures, discontiguous units and multiple categories.

The app supports configurable multi-layer annotation and task management, and is written in Django and AngularJS.

## UCCA Parser

TUPA is a transition-based parser for Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation (UCCA), developed by Daniel Hershcovich, Omri Abend and Ari Rappoport.

## Shared Tasks

UCCA was targeted in the following public parsing competitions, which accompanied top-tier NLP conferences:

**SemEval 2019 Task 1**

The task included open and closed tracks on English, French and German UCCA corpora from Wikipedia and Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea.

Evaluation is done by labeled F1 on the graph edges, matched by child terminal yield.

**CoNLL 2019 MRP Shared Task**

The task included parsing to [AMR](https://amr.isi.edu/), UCCA, [DM, PSD](http://sdp.delph-in.net/), and [EDS](http://moin.delph-in.net/EdsTop).
The UCCA training data is freely available.

UCCA evaluation is done both by UCCA F1 (as in SemEval 2019) and by the MRP metric, which is similar to [smatch](https://github.com/snowblink14/smatch). The training data contains 6,572 sentences from web reviews and Wikipedia. There are two evaluation sets: one with 1,131, from the same domains (Full), and one with 87 sentences, from The Little Prince (LPP). Note that due to an error, 535 of the 1,131 Full Evaluation sentences were included in the training data, and therefore the full evaluation scores are an overestimate. The LPP scores are unaffected by this.
