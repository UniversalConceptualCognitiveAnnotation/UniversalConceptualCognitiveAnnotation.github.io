# ![UCCA logo](logo6.png) The UCCA Resource Webpage

Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation (UCCA) is a novel semantic approach to grammatical representation. It was developed in the Computational Linguistics Lab of the Hebrew University by [Omri Abend](http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~oabend) and [Ari Rappoport](http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~arir).

The central idea of the project is to analyze and annotate natural languages using purely semantic categories and structure (a graph). Syntactic categories and structure are not part of the manual annotation, and are ideally learned implicitly by the parsers. The basic set of semantic categories (the foundational layer) is inspired by work in linguistic typology, cognitive grammar, and neuroscience. The development of additional layers, such as semantic roles and super-senses (adapted from the [CARMLS project](https://github.com/nert-gu/streusle/)) is underway.

The annotation so far focused on argument-structure and linkage phenomena. We build primarily on _Basic Linguistic Theory_ (R.M.W. Dixon, 2010a; 2010b; 2012), a widely used approach for language description. We acknowledge that there many applicable analyses for a given sentence, but select, for practical reasons, a small set of highly useful distinctions, and apply them to provide one plausible annotation.

We have annotated 160K tokens from English Wikipedia with the UCCA scheme, as well as a 30K English-French parallel corpus based on Jules Verne's "20K Leagues Under The Sea", and a 120K tokens corpus of the entire book in German. Pilot studies were conducted on several other languages as well.

This page contains links to all of UCCA's resources: corpora, annotation guidelines, parser and code. If you use these resources in your research, please cite the following or other relevant [publications](#publications):

## Annotation Web-App

The UCCAApp web application for phrase-based annotation in general, and UCCA parsing in particular can be found here.

Formally, it supports DAG structures, discontiguous units and multiple categories.

The app supports configurable multi-layer annotation and task management, and is written in Django and AngularJS.

## Guidelines

UCCA-annotated corpora include the guidelines version they were compiled with in their repository. The most up to date guidelines are available here (the most recent one is generally in draft mode, but see releases): \[[pdf](https://github.com/UniversalConceptualCognitiveAnnotation/docs)\].

## UCCA Parser

TUPA is a transition-based parser for Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation (UCCA), developed by Daniel Hershcovich, Omri Abend and Ari Rappoport. \[[Code](https://github.com/danielhers/tupa/)\] \[[Demo](http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~danielh/ucca/)\]

## Source Code

Python source code for reading and manipulating the UCCA structures. The code was written by Amit Beka and Daniel Hershcovich. \[[Code](https://github.com/danielhers/ucca)\]
